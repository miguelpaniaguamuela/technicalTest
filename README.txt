Massive Spawn button spawns the amount of objects that we have specified in its input.
Massive Recycle button recycles the amount of objects that we have specified in its input.

The SPAWNED and POOLED texts under them specify the amount of objects that are currently being used (SPAWNED)
and the amount of objects that are stored in the object pool (POOLED).

The slider at the bottom shows the percentage of objects stored in the object pool of all the objects.

In the right corner we can see the fps.
