This test contains:

 - Unity project ready to be imported from Unity 2018.2
 - A first test to evaluate programming and optimization skills, implementing a Spawner
 - A second test (to implement the first test in 2D and for WebGL)

Steps:

Open the Unity Project and find all "QUESTION" comments. You will see something like that:

// QUESTION 4: Add a new status called "Spawning" that should be called from a key press (for example Space) or from a button click
public enum GameStatus { Loading, Playing }

There are 9 QUESTIONS that should be resolved in order.

Once you finish the first test, the result should be a very simple spawner and destroyer. Keep the project as simple as possible and avoid to use 3rd party plugins.
You can use as many UI Objects as you need to implement an interface to interact with the game.

The second tests consists in a variant of the first one, but instead of using Cubes you've to instantiate 2D Images using the Unity UI System,
and a build for WebGL.

If you've any question don't hesitate to ask us in: daniel.santeugini@tangelogames.com

Good luck and have fun!
